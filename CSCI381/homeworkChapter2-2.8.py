"""Exercise 2.8
(Table with Number of Bacteria) Starting with 200 bacteria, the growth in the number of bacteria after n hours is
calculated as follows: B = 200 Ã— 2^n. Print the number of bacteria after 0, 5, 10, and 15 hours in table format as
shown below. Use the tab escape sequence to achieve the two-column output.
Hour    Number of Bacteria
0       200
5       6400
10      204800
15      6553600 """
