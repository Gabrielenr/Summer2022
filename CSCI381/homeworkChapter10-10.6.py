"""Exercise 10.6
(Calculating Vector Lengths) A vector is an object that has a magnitude and a direction.
A vector is represented as a line segment with an arrow where the arrow represents
the direction and the length of the vector is the magnitude. A vector can also be a single
point with x- and y-coordinates. The magnitude calculated from this type of vector equals
the distance between the origin of the cartesian coordinate system and the point. Write a
class Point that represents an (x-y) coordinate pair and provides x and y read-write
properties as well as a method to calculate the distance between the point and the origin of the
coordinate system. Include __init__ and __repr__ methods. Write a class Vector that
has two Point objects as its attributes. Include __init__ and __repr__ methods and a
method that can calculate the magnitude of the vector. Test your Point and your
Vector class."""
