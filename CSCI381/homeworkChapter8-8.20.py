"""Exercise 8.20
(Regular Expressions: Munging Dates) Dates are stored and displayed in several
common formats. Three common formats are
042555
04/25/1955
April 25, 1955
Use regular expressions to search a string containing dates, find substrings that match
these formats and munge them into the other formats. The original string should have
one date in each format, so there will be a total of six transformations.
