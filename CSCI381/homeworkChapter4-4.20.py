"""Exercise 4.20
(Intro to Data Science: Population Variance vs. Sample Variance) We mentioned
in the Intro to Data Science section that there’s a slight difference between the way the
statistics module’s functions calculate the population variance and the sample variance.
The same is true for the population standard deviation and the sample standard deviation.
Research the reason for these differences."""

""" Population variance refers to the value of variance that is calculated from population data, 
and sample variance is the variance calculated from sample data. Due to this value of denominator 
in the formula for variance in case of sample data is ‘n-1’, and it is ‘n’ for population data. 
As a result both variance and standard deviation derived from sample data are more than those found 
out from population data. """
