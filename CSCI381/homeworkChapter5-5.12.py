""" Exercise 5.12
Write a script that displays one of the main characters of the series and asks the user
which actor played the role. The programmer can choose to either display the actorsâ€™
names and let the player chose one or to not display any options at all.
After each question, the player is informed if their answer was correct. The game is
finished when the user has linked five actors to five characters correctly. At the end of the
game, the number of correct guesses is displayed on the screen."""
